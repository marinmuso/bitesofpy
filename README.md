## PyBites

PyBites is a platform that offers test-driven coding challenges. To learn more about the platform click [here](https://pybit.es).

## Motivation

This is a link to [my profile](https://codechalleng.es/profiles/marinmuso). I particularly enjoy the coding challenges because I love learning new concepts and reinforcing what I already know.

I work on the challenges, commonly referred to as "bites", locally and then sync with the platform to advance my progress. Not all bites that I have completed are on this repo.
